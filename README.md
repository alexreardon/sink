# sink

A little script to help with the migration of Atlaskit components from flow to typescript.

- It uses [`flowtees`](TODO) to generate TypeScript build files
- It uses [`@khell/flow-to-ts`](TODO) to do a best effort attempt at converting flow files to typescript

## Usage

```bash
npx @alexreardon/sink [path-to-package]
```

## Usage: with global install

```bash
yarn global add @alexreardon/sink
sink [path-to-package]
```]
